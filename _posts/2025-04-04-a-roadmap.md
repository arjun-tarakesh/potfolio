## `$ echo "Closing Thoughts"`

This blog will serve as a **digital terminal** where I record what I learn, build, and break (responsibly). Whether you're just starting out or deep in blue team work, I hope the logs here are useful to you too.

Feel free to explore my [About page](https://arjuntarakesh.com/about/) for a digital version of my resume.
