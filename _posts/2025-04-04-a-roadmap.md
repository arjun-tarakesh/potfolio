\# \`$ whoami\`



Hi, I'm \*\*Arjun Tarakesh\*\* — a cybersecurity analyst and lifelong learner with hands-on experience in \*\*SOC operations, EDR, SIEM configuration, IAM\*\*, and \*\*compliance auditing\*\*.  

With a Distinction in MSc \*\*Information Security\*\* from \*Royal Holloway, University of London\*, my focus is on building secure, automated, and scalable defenses.



This post is a running \*\*log file of my journey\*\*, what I’ve already explored, and what I’m currently sharpening or learning from scratch.

\## \`$ cat ~/knowledge_base.log\`



\### ✅ Existing Skills & Practical Experience



\| Domain | Highlights |

\|--------|------------|

\| \*\*SOC Operations\*\* | Worked in structured SOC environments with experience triaging incidents and creating detection playbooks |

\| \*\*SIEM Engineering\*\* | Deployed and maintained Splunk, Wazuh & ELK; wrote correlation rules and dashboards |

\| \*\*EDR & Endpoint Management\*\* | Managed 500+ endpoints using Sophos XDR and Endpoint Central |

\| \*\*IAM & MFA\*\* | Implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), MFA enforcement and IAM policies |

\| \*\*Security Compliance\*\* | Hands-on with Cyber Essentials, ISO 27001 readiness, GDPR mapping |

\| \*\*Automation\*\* | Built remediation and detection scripts in PowerShell & Python |

\| \*\*Cloud & Admin\*\* | Experience with Microsoft 365 Admin Center, Defender, and Entra ID |

\## \`$ tail -f ~/now.md\`



As part of my \*\*continuous upskilling\*\*, I’m brushing up on:



\- \*\*SOC workflows\*\* and real-time detection engineering  

\- \*\*SIEM log parsing\*\*, detection writing & dashboarding  

\- \*\*Incident response processes\*\* from detection to containment  

\- \*\*Threat intelligence gathering\*\* and tactical intelligence mapping  

\- \*\*MITRE ATT&CK framework\*\* for detection & adversary emulation



\---



\## \`$ learn --parallel ~/labs/webapp.md\`



In parallel, I’ve started learning \*\*Web Application Penetration Testing\*\* with a focus on:



\- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities  

\- Burp Suite workflows  

\- Reconnaissance and fuzzing  

\- Basic exploitation and reporting  

\- Mapping findings to MITRE & CVEs



\> This is a developing skill — I’ll be documenting all my lab experiments, tools, and learning here.

## `$ echo "Closing Thoughts"`

This blog will serve as a **digital terminal** where I record what I learn, build, and break (responsibly). Whether you're just starting out or deep in blue team work, I hope the logs here are useful to you too.

Feel free to explore my [About page](https://arjuntarakesh.com/about/) for a digital version of my resume.
