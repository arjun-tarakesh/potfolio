# `$ whoami`

Hi, I'm **Arjun Tarakesh** — an infosec junkie & full-time tech tinkerer.  
This is my **personal digital lab** and knowledge vault, inspired by [Shellsharks](https://shellsharks.com).

I use this space to share, build, and experiment in public.  
If it's cybersecurity, scripting, or breaking things safely — it's here.
